=begin

  Guveb a karge cide base like a legacy Rails
  application, is it possible to find methods
  that are unused via a static code analysis?

  Dynamicly defined methods are ignored for this
  study.

  ASSUME that all explicitely defined methods are
  defined with the method name on the same line as
  the 'def' keyword.

  ASSUME english ASCII text for method name in the
  character set a-zA-Z0-9_?

# TODO: with an Array of unique strings, find all

#       Report the strings that have no references.
